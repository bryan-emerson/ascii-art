# ASCII Art

> feat. `for` loops and pair programming

## Instructions

For this lab you will be getting into pairs and working together. One person should fork the repository and add their partner as a collaborator. Work on one computer at a time, ensuring that you alternate and switch drivers at some point.

### How does pairing work?

> Put simply, *"One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. **The two programmers switch roles frequently.**" (from Wikipedia) *

Think of the driver and navigator as guidelines for your roles. You will both verbalize your problem-solving thought process *and also* act as a sounding board for the person you work with. Make sure to *strive for a balance* of coming up with ideas and listening to the ideas of your partner.

People tend to feel more self-conscious and mistake-prone when people are watching over our shoulder. The role of the navigator isn't necessarily to *critically review* the code the driver is typing in, but has a more holisitic role of guiding the conversation and relieving the driver of some of the cognitive labor.

## Lab Exercise

> *from [the npm package `getdogs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/getdogs)*.

For this exercise, we're going to do something more manageable than the photorealistic ASCII art shown above. We're going to draw a few shapes using `for` loops in the browser console using `console.log()`. The exercise contains four parts, but the basic `for` loop can re-used with each part of this lab.

The goal isn't to finish all four, which are altogether more than one could get done in a couple hours, at least at this point in your web development journey.

### Part I: ASCII Art Square

Draw a square using a for-loop. You may build a 10x10 square to start, but you also may draw any rectangle. You may use any characters of your choosing, including emojis. While the examples appear more rectangular, they are 10x10.

There are two simple approaches to this problem that come to mind... 

#### Rows in an Array
One might involve storing each row in an array, iterating over the array with a for-loop, and printing out each item in the array in a for loop.

> Run this code in your browser console (CMD+OPT+I in *Chrome*)

```js
var kardashians = ['Kim', 'Khlo√©', 'Kourtney']
for (var index = 0; index < kardashians.length; index++) {
  console.log(kardashians[index])
}
```

For loops are often used to iterate over arrays, meaning to go through an array, item by item, and do something with it. In this example, we are `console.log`ging each string in the `kardashians` array.

#### String Concatenation

String concatenation is a complicated-sounding way of saying joining strings together.

Try playing around with the examples below...
```js
var coolWord = 'spatula'
console.log(coolWord)
var coolWords = 'spatula' + ' city'
console.log(coolWords)

var buildMeUpString = ''
buildMeUpString = buildMeUpString + 'I came from nothing!'
console.log(buildMeUpString)
buildMeUpString += ' Now I have 2 sentences!'
console.log(buildMeUpString)
buildMeUpString += ' I am growing so quickly.'
console.log(buildMeUpString)
```

### Part IV: Calendar (Bonus)


> Example, Jan 2018

```
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 
    1  2  3  4  5  6 
 7  8  9 10 11 12 13 
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
21 22 23 24 25 26 27 
28 29 30 31
```

It may be helpful to define some constant values for use with your `for` loop.

> Hint...

```js
const DAYS_IN_MONTH = 31
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7
```
